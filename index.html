	            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
	            <p>Welcome to my blog. I made this thing a long way back but I'm thinking of reviving it so I can do something interesting. Not sure what it is, though! >_></p>

	            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
	            <p>Welcome to my humble blog. I don't quite know what I'll be posting yet, but it seems as though my blog will consist mostly of:</p>
	            <ul>
	              <li>Projects I'm working on, anything really from programming to music</li>
	              <li>Random stuff about my personal life (so I can pretend people listen)</li>
	              <li>and opinions on current events or other stuff (so I can pretend people listen)</li>
	            </ul>
	            <p></p>
	            <p>Of course my blog might not cover exactly or exclusively these things, but... just a head's up, I guess.</p>
	            <p>I've been monkeying around a little with the CSS. I've known how to use HTML and CSS for a few years now, and I decided to put my skills to the test by building this site's design from the ground up (originally, I had planned on using Bootstrap).</p>
	            <p>An additional warning: I might not post often. I have a ton of work, even on break right now. I'll do what I can but I'm not sure if I will be able to post super consistently.</p>
