##generating chord progressions with a recurrent Autoencoder architecture##
_August 8, 2019_
This is my first foray into machine learning! I've always been excited by this stuff and found myself wanting to jump in.

Before this, I hadn't had much hands-on experience with ML. I took a few online courses, some of which had example exercises, but the task of writing this thing completely by myself proved to be daunting. This also ended up being pretty difficult; in retrospect I probably would have started myself off with something simpler, as I had to get through the initial mental hurdle of being able to write anything at all.

But enough about me.
